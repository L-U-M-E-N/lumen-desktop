Lumen (yeah, don't need to write the dots everywhere) is a simple and modulable personal assistant built on Electron. The goal of that software was originally to make some small tools I needed in my everydaylife.

After few years, I now decided to publicy share a cleaner version of the code and the software to make people interested by it using and improving it.
